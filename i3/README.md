# README

The two files in this folder are to be used with the `geni3` script in the `scripts/` directory on this repo. For any `themename.style` in the `~/style/theme/` directory, calling `geni3 themename` will combine the `i3-main` and `themename.style` files into one file at `.config/i3/config`.
This allows the user to have multiple themes in `~/style/theme/` while still using one main configuration file for shortcuts and startup programs, et cetera.
